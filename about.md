I'm **zan.e**, I'm an 🇮🇹 IT student at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

I'm interested in almost every aspect of cybersecurity but I primarily focus on web and network security. I'm kinda attracted to cryptography too but I don't really understand those shenanigans.

I'm also an active CTF player <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/194130" target="_blank">@bhackari</a>.
